      <h1>about me</h1>
      greetings! i'm phil hartmann, a devoted student with a penchant for weaving captivating web experiences. by day, i contribute to a company specializing in distributing checkboxes, and by night, i'm immersed in the dynamic world of web development.

      my journey into the realm of code commenced in 8th grade when i uncovered the enchantment of creating digital landscapes. one achievement in my portfolio is the website for my school's choir, accessible at <a href="https://schülermachenoper.de">schülermachenoper.de</a>, where me and a fellow student from my year created a digital space using html, css, and javascript. this project stands as a testament to the harmonious blend of technology and creativity.

      i am proficient in an array of programming languages, for example java, python, c, javascript, and kotlin. git, ansible, linux, bash, docker, and more are tools i wield skillfully, shaping the digital canvas to bring ideas to life.

      i have a particular fondness for minimalism and the transformative process of watching a website evolve into its envisioned form. my journey with computers started at a young age, and i currently navigate the digital landscape using linux for its privacy and security advantages over other platforms.

      join me on this digital odyssey as we explore the intersection of code, creativity, and functionality. let's build experiences that not only meet expectations but exceed them.
